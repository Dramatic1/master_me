master_me is a multi-platform, free and open source audio plug-in which optimizes sound in live streaming situations.
Introducing no latency, it takes care of master levels and ‘polishes’ the sound with a chain of effects, closely modeled after the audio chain of Klaus Scheuermann’s mastering studio in Berlin, Germany.

Made with FAUST and DPF.
